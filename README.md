It all began three years ago, when my delightful-yet-computer-illiterate friend Sylvia needed a way to alter the sound of a video artwork according to its brightness. At the time I only knew one person to ask, my artist/coder/teacher/friend, Joseph Knierzinger. Through his guidance we wrote a script together in Python that was exactly what Sylvia needed. The situation was a perfect sum of all its parts: Joseph knew which Python libraries he could import, but didn’t have a clear picture of what Sylvia had in mind. On the other hand Sylvia had a very clear concept, yet few practical means to realize her vision. I was there in the middle, simply electrified, thirsting for more programming skills.
